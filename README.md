# study-tracker-scheduler
The goal of this project is to create a helpful CLI based system for students/anyone to create schedules that can be uploaded to Google Calendar and to track their progress in studies/subject.
No AI, just me, my keyboard and Google. You might ask why, well just so I can practice my own ability to solve problems more efficiently.
Please check out user-stories.md if you're more interested in my thought process behind this and to see what the final structure will look like.
